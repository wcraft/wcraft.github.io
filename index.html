				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>I am an investigative data reporter, specializing in government accountability. I use public records, data analysis, and in-depth reporting to cover criminal justice, the environment, and the way our institutions function. I worked with APM Reports, a team of public radio reporters from 2015 to 2022. My work has appeared on NPR, Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting, and public radio stations around the country. It has been honored with two Peabodies, a DuPont, and a George Polk award. More importantly, it has spurred policy changes that have made a difference in peopleâ€™s lives.</p>

                    <li><a href="https://features.apmreports.org/sent-away/">
                        Sent Away</a> - Sent Away is a podcast about the troubled teen industry in Utah, made in collaboration with KUER Public Radio and the Salt Lake Tribune. I turned tens of thousands of pages of public records into data to investigate how the state has failed to hold the industry accountable. </li>
                    <li><a href="https://features.apmreports.org/in-the-dark/">
                        In The Dark Season's 1 and 2</a> - I was the data reporter for the first two seasons of our podcast In The Dark. Our first season covered the kidnapping of Jacob Wetterling and the sheriff's department that failed to solve the case for decades. Our second season was about Curtis Flowers, a man tried six times for the same crime. My reporting on the issues of racial bias in jury selection in Curtis' case was cited at the US Supreme Court when they voted to overturn his conviction.
