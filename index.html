				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>I am an investigative data reporter, specializing in government accountability. I use public records, data analysis, and in-depth reporting to cover criminal justice, the environment, and the way our institutions function. I worked with APM Reports, a team of public radio reporters from 2015 to 2022. My work has appeared on NPR, Reveal from the Center for Investigative Reporting, public radio stations around the country, and the podcasts <a href="https://features.apmreports.org/in-the-dark/"><i>In The Dark</i></a> and <a href="https://features.apmreports.org/sent-away/"><i>Sent Away</i></a>. It has been honored with two Peabodies, a DuPont, and a George Polk award. More importantly, it has spurred policy changes that have made a difference in people’s lives.</p>

					<a href="https://www.apmreports.org/story/2021/06/23/provo-canyon-school-utah-teen-concussion">The teen got a concussion. The school got a pass.</a>
					<p>Up until 2019, the agency regulating Utah’s massive youth treatment industry rarely cited facilities for violating rules — even after cases of abuse. After a 2016 incident left a teenager with a concussion, state regulators listened to his mom’s complaint — and then did nothing about it.</p>

					<a href="https://www.apmreports.org/story/2020/05/04/epa-lead-pipes-drinking-water">How the EPA has left Americans exposed to lead in drinking water</a>
					<p>Millions of people still get water through lead pipes. For decades, lax EPA rules missed hazardous lead levels and allowed some utilities to remain indifferent. Today the Trump administration is rushing to finalize a plan that might make things worse.</p>

					<a href="https://www.apmreports.org/story/2019/02/07/great-lakes-water-shutoffs">In cities on the Great Lakes, water pipes are crumbling and poor people are paying the price</a>
					<p>Americans are struggling to afford their rising water bills, and thousands of poor families have had their service shut off. This growing crisis has a dark irony: It's especially acute in a region where water is most abundant — the Great Lakes.</p>

					<a href="https://www.apmreports.org/story/2018/06/12/mississippi-da-doug-evans-has-long-history-of-striking-black-people-from-juries">Mississippi D.A. Doug Evans has long history of striking Black people from juries</a>
					<p>We gathered data on juries in central Mississippi going back 26 years. Analyzing hundreds of trials, we found that prosecutors were more than four times more likely to exclude Black jurors.</p>

					<a href="https://www.apmreports.org/story/2018/06/05/how-did-curtis-flowers-end-up-with-a-nearly-all-white-jury">How did Curtis Flowers end up with a nearly all-white jury?</a>
					<p>In 2010, a jury of 11 whites and one African-American convicted Flowers and sentenced him to death. Defense attorneys would later claim the trial essentially had been decided in jury selection. Here's how it went down.</p>
